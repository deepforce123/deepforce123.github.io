            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            Hi there! üëã My name is Ruesion, and I'm a 3D modeler and aspiring artist. As a 3D modeler, I specialize in creating high-quality and detailed models for video games and other applications. I've been honing my skills for over 3 years, and I'm always pushing myself to learn new techniques and stay up-to-date with industry standards.<br><br>
            
            In addition to 3D modeling, I'm also passionate about art in all its forms. Whether it's painting, drawing, or sculpting, I believe that art has the power to inspire and move people in a way that nothing else can. I'm constantly seeking out new inspirations and ideas for my own work, and I hope to one day make a lasting impact in the 3D modeling community.<br><br>
    
            When I'm not working on 3D models or creating art, you can usually find me listening to music or watching movies with my friends. I'm a firm believer in the importance of work-life balance, and I always make time for the things that I love. Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you want to chat, collaborate, or start a commission!" ü§ñ<br><br>
